# Patent Scraping Script #
Written in Python 3.5 (I know...)

## Overview ##
Search US patents by Keyword and/or Company (Assignee) and get a CSV chronologically ordered by the publishing date. Extremely self explanatory for now. 

Working on easy integration with Google Sheets and Gmail for email updates. Please leave me feedback at [@wileycwj](https://twitter.com/wileycwj) on Twitter.
